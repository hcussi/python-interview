### Getting Started

Several code examples are provided that demonstrates how to solve different problems that might encounter in interviews or coding challenges. 

### Environment

- Python 3.11

Miniconda is used to create virtual environments. Check the `requirements.txt` file in order to build one for your one.
You will see many dependencies that are not used in the code base but are added by default by `conda`, feel free to remove those.

#### Setting up

Create and activate an environment with `conda` or other. Can be created from the `requirements.txt` or directly and then use `pip` to install dependencies.

#### Running script

````bash
python inverse-tree/main.py
````
